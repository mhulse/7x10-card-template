**Use these files to print A7 envelopes from your inkjet using MS Word.**

## Post office

* As far as the US(PS) mail system is concerned, you can put as much branding as you want on the back side of the envelope.
* On the front side, you must reserve 4" of blank white space for official post office business; the rest of the document can have your branding.
* USPS has specific requirements for [address formatting](http://pe.usps.com/businessmail101/addressing/deliveryAddress.htm).
